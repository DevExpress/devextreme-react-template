The DevExtreme React Template allows you to create an application with several views and a hierarchical menu (see the [live preview](https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-react-template)).

You can use [DevExtreme CLI](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-cli) commands to modify, add, and delete views, configure the menu, and change themes.

The DevExtreme React Template is based on [DevExtreme React components](https://github.com/devexpress/devextreme-react) and generated with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
